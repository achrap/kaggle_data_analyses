### kaggle_data_science repository: introduction

---

As my goal is to become machine learning expert one day, I have to learn a lot!

My first thought was to learn by doing. For me it is one of the most effective ways to actually learn something.

I use the datasets available on Kaggle and process the data. I try to apply different algorithms to better understand data science principles.

Brief description of contents (will be updated):

- *coffee-beans-review*.ipynb - Jupyter notebook which I created to analyze dataset with coffee beans review
- *data-visualization-workshop*.ipynb - Jupyter notebook which I created as a co-host of the free online workshop series about data analysis using Python. I presented this material to a group of 20 people.
